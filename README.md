# Crystal Substitution Cipher Keys Game
## 2024-07-29 Update

I've had to change from the ESP32-C3 to the regular ESP32 for this game. SPI on the C3 under the Arduino framework is pretty broken right now.

The current code is VERY crude and is just meant to get us through the tech demo tomorrow. That said the code deos work on the real hardware which is now operational minus the IR stuff. [YouTube Video of game play](https://youtu.be/hAiisymlQl4)
